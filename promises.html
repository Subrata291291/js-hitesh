    <!-- A Promise can be in one of three states: -->

    <!-- Pending	The operation is still running
    Fulfilled (Resolved)	The operation finished successfully
    Rejected	The operation failed -->

    <!-- 🧠 Example 1: Creating a Promise
    let myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    let success = true;

    if (success) {
        resolve("✅ Task completed successfully!");
    } else {
        reject("❌ Something went wrong!");
    }
    }); -->


    <!-- Now, you use the promise like this:

    myPromise
    .then(result => console.log(result))  // Runs when resolved
    .catch(error => console.error(error)) // Runs when rejected
    .finally(() => console.log("Promise finished")); // Always runs -->


    <!-- 🧾 Output (if success = true):

    ✅ Task completed successfully!
    Promise finished -->
